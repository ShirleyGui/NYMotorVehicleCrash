People who visit New York for the first time are often surprised by New Yorkers who go across the street without looking at the traffic lights. “Is it safe to walk like this?” This must be the first thought that springs to mind. The rule of thumb among New Yorkers is to never wait for a green light. Ignoring the traffic light may result in traffic collisions, prompting us to investigate automobile crash behaviors in New York City. We explored and gathered data from the NYPD to better understand the causes of car crash accidents and diverse behaviors among boroughs in NYC in order to address these concerns.
We found our data on New York Police Department (NYPD) Motor Vehicle Collisions webpage:  https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/traffic-data/traffic-data-collision.page . The dataset is updated on a monthly basis and spans from January to August 2021. It consists of three parts: collision details (number of vehicles damaged, number of individuals injured or killed), vehicle type descriptions, and contributing factors.
