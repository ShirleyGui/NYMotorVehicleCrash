[["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results", " Chapter 5 Results Let’s shift our focus a little bit and come to another motivating concern of this project: Are people at different positions during vehicle collisions equally injured? Does certain category of individual have a higher death rate during collisions? First we want to take a look at the patterns of number of individuals involved in motor vehicle accidents in our dataset. As mentioned in earlier sections, our data spreads across 5 boroughs in New York: Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island. We can see from the grpah that Brooklyn and Queens has the most total counts of individuals involved in collisions, which matches our discovery in previous sections that: ??? A general pattern across the boroughs is that Drivers seem to have a highest proportion of presence in collisions,followed by passengers, which is quite self-explanatory, as car collisions should always involve drivers and sometimes there are passengers in cars. We can see that the boroughs could be split into 3 sets based on total counts of individuals involved in collisions: Brooklyn and queens, Bronx and Manhattan, and Staten Island by itself. There exist gaps of counts between the groups, we believe this is due to the total amount of traffic, population, and other factors. This also matches with our discovery earlier:??? Now we notice that there seems to be a general pattern across boroughs. To better visualize the pattern, we decided to plot them in proportions. We can see that the distribution of different types of transportation remains the same across different boroughs at New York. As we can see from above, there is no geographical differences over types of individuals getting injured or killed in motor vehicle accidents in New York. Thus, we could be confident to merge the injured/killed counts across different boroughs. Back to the main focus of the topic, which type of individual will most likely get killed We can see that there’s a difference in scale between injured and killed. We decide to come up with a new term: survive ## Driver Passenger Cyclist Pedestrian ## 1 0.9962103 0.9967213 0.9942197 0.9846939 We can see that pedestrians have the lowest survive rate while injured in a motor vehicle accident: 0.9847, while the other 3 types all have a survive rate of larger than 0.99. There’re multiple reasons and guesses most population least protection: passenger &gt; motor (as sometimes only motor invovled) &gt; cyclist &gt; ped Expected value Number_of_Motor_Vehicle_Collisions "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).

[["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Vehicle Collison Dataset 3.2 Contributing Factor Dataset", " Chapter 3 Data transformation We have three data sets in total, but we will only look at “GeoCollisions_1” and “GeoContributingFactors_3” for our analysis. In this section, we will go over the data pre-processing. If you are looking for more information on the original code, please see our github repo chapter. 3.1 Vehicle Collison Dataset We will explore two topics using the “GeoCollisions_1” dataset: 1. collision distribution 2. type of people involved in crashes. Because the second question can be answered directly from the raw dataset and does not require transformation, we only transform the dataset for the first. The following are the steps: Remove the metadata (first 3 rows and last 8 rows) Create two sub datasets: a. contains rows for borough wide data; b. contains rows for precinct wide data In precinct wide sub-data, add a column borough to identify which borough this precinct belongs to Add columns not_severe_collisions and severe_pct to identify the total number of not severe collisions and proportion of severe collisions for every precinct In borough wide sub-data, add collision_type and value to illustrate the number of collisions for each type of every borough After cleaning the data, we have 3 variables with 10 observations for borough wide data, and 7 variables with 77 observation for precinct wide data. Table 3.1: Vehicle Collision Dataset A (borough wide) Column Description Name borough name CollisionType severe/not severe Value number of accidents Table 3.2: Vehicle Collision Dataset B (precinct wide) Column Description Borough borough name GeoCode precinct code GeocodeLabel precinct name NumberofMotorVehicleCollisions number of car accidents InjuryorFatalCollisions number of severe car accidents NotSevereCollisions number of not severe car accidents SeverePct number of severe/number of total car accidents 3.2 Contributing Factor Dataset The “GeoContributingFactors_3” dataset presents data at three levels: citywide, borough wide, and precinct wide. We will perform our analysis based on the first two levels, so we will filter out the data from those levels and double-check if the sum of borough data equals citywide data. Furthermore, the dataset contains 30 detailed causes of car accidents in New York City from January to October 2021. We will combine some of them to create a more comprehensive picture of the root causes. The steps are as following. Remove the metadata (first 3 rows and last 8 rows) Filter the column GeoCode i.e. only contains citywide and borough-wide data. Check if citywide data is matched with borough-wide data Add a new column ContributingFactorGroup based on ContributingFactorDescription Convert the new column to factor After cleaning the data, we have 6 variables with 153 observations.
