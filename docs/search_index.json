In this section, we will go over the data pre-processing. If you are looking for more information on the original code, please see our github repo chapter. 3.1 Vehicle Collison Dataset We will explore two topics using the “GeoCollisions_1” dataset: 1. collision distribution 2. type of people involved in crashes. Because the second question can be answered directly from the raw dataset and does not require transformation, we only transform the dataset for the first. The following are the steps: Remove the metadata (first 3 rows and last 8 rows) Create two sub datasets: a. contains rows for borough wide data; b. contains rows for precinct wide data In precinct wide sub-data, add a column borough to identify which borough this precinct belongs to Add columns not_severe_collisions and severe_pct to identify the total number of not severe collisions and proportion of severe collisions for every precinct In borough wide sub-data, add collision_type and value to illustrate the number of collisions for each type of every borough After cleaning the data, we have 3 variables with 10 observations for borough wide data, and 7 variables with 77 observation for precinct wide data. Table 3.1: Vehicle Collision Dataset A (borough wide) Column Description Name borough name CollisionType severe/not severe Value number of accidents Table 3.2: Vehicle Collision Dataset B (precinct wide) Column Description Borough borough name GeoCode precinct code GeocodeLabel precinct name NumberofMotorVehicleCollisions number of car accidents InjuryorFatalCollisions number of severe car accidents NotSevereCollisions number of not severe car accidents SeverePct number of severe/number of total car accidents 3.2 Contributing Factor Dataset The “GeoContributingFactors_3” dataset presents data at three levels: citywide, borough wide, and precinct wide. We will perform our analysis based on the first two levels, so we will filter out the data from those levels and double-check if the sum of borough data equals citywide data. Furthermore, the dataset contains 30 detailed causes of car accidents in New York City from January to October 2021. We will combine some of them to create a more comprehensive picture of the root causes. The steps are as following. Remove the metadata (first 3 rows and last 8 rows) Filter the column GeoCode i.e. only contains citywide and borough-wide data. Check if citywide data is matched with borough-wide data Add a new column ContributingFactorGroup based on ContributingFactorDescription Convert the new column to factor After cleaning the data, we have 6 variables with 153 observations.
